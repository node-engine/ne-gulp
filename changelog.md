All require statements (BF DN)
- When using ne-auto the require statements did not find the module
- Are now conditional to be compatible with ne-auto
- If there is a process.env.NE_AUTO then the require statements use the ne-auto if not then they require from root
- Now this module will work with ne-auto and without ne-auto
- DN tag because this is connected to dependencies
